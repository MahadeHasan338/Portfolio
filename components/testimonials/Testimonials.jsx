During the time we worked together, I have seen how dedicated he was towards his work and how skillfully he overcame complex challenges that are essential to being a software engineer. I got him detail oriented and rarely has any bugs in his finished product. I can say that he has tremendous potential to face any challenges in a complex project. The nicest thing is that he is a wonderful team player and knows how to fulfill the artistic objectives of the project in the best way possible.I would whole-heartedly recommend Shohel for your Software Engineer position and I believe you should seize the opportunity to have a dynamic and skilled programmer on your team.",
