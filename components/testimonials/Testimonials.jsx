The nicest thing is that he is a wonderful team player and knows how to fulfill the artistic objectives of the project in the best way possible.I would whole-heartedly recommend Shohel for your Software Engineer position and I believe you should seize the opportunity to have a dynamic and skilled programmer on your team.",
